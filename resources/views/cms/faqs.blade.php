                            A Sugar Daddy is a wealthy man who compensates a Sugar Baby in some form for spending time with him. That could mean dates, a physical relationship, or even trips and vacations.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There are no particular requirements Sugar Daddies have to meet. However, Sugar Babies are expensive; most Sugar Daddies pay them at least $100 per date or a few thousand dollars per month as an allowance.
                        </p>
                        Because of the expenses they incur, most Sugar Daddies are men in their thirties, forties, or even older in high-paying fields like finance or law.

                            Sugar dating is a type of romantic relationship based on exchange. The "Sugar Baby" in the partnership exchanges their companionship for financial compensation provided by a "Sugar Daddy" ( or occasionally a "Sugar Momma").
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Most of the time, this involves a relationship between a wealthy, older man and a young, beautiful woman — but people of all genders and ages can take part.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As long as both parties are legal adults, there are no lower or upper limits on sugar daters; in theory, a Sugar Daddy could be younger than his Sugar Baby! Although it's less common, sugar relationships can also involve rich Sugar Mommas and young male Sugar Babies.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It's worth pointing out that sugar relationships don't necessarily involve physical relationships — especially not sexual relationships. To give you an idea of the variety, sociologist Maren Scull <a href="https://phys.org/news/2019-10-sugar-daddy-relationships.html">identified seven types</a> of sugar relationships:
                        </p>
                        <ul class="mb-5">
                            <li>
                                <strong>Sugar prostitution.</strong> The type of sugar dating we most often hear about in the media — a transactional relationship where Sugar Babies exchange sexual favors for money, with zero emotional connection. We don't endorse this type of relationship on Sharing Sugar since prostitution is illegal in the United States.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Compensated dating.</strong> Sugar babies receive a payment each time they go on a date with their Sugar Daddy — this could involve having lunch together or attending a fancy event.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Compensated companionship.</strong> Similar to compensated dating. Many Sugar Daddies simply want somebody to talk to and enjoy time with rather than a physical or even romantic relationship. The level of commitment conventional friendships demand can be difficult for career-driven, successful like Sugar Daddies. Instead, they'd prefer to get on with their busy lives and meet somebody on their terms.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Sugar dating.</strong> You might think sugar dating is just a synonym for compensated dating, but there are slight differences. Sugar dating is a more holistic arrangement. Sugar babies typically receive a monthly or weekly allowance in return for an ongoing sugar relationship — this may be more physical than compensated companionship.

                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Sugar friendships.</strong> The main difference between sugar friendships and compensated companionships is that sugar friendships tend to involve people who knew each other before developing a sugar dating relationship.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Sugar friendships with benefits.</strong> Standard sugar friendships and sugar friendships with benefits have one key difference, and it's exactly what you're thinking: sexual relations. However, it's less transactional than sugar prostitution as there's usually some level of emotional connection.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Pragmatic love.</strong> This isn't what most people think of when they hear about sugar dating — pragmatic love is for people who envision their relationship continuing in the long run. Why would anyone want a long-run sugar relationship? Above all, it's a lifestyle choice. In sugar dating, the boundaries and "rules" of the relationship are crystal clear. For anyone who values their independence and wants to focus on themselves before committing to a long-term relationship, this can be an attractive prospect. But just because these people don't want to have an exclusive, committed partnership, it doesn't mean they don't want to enjoy the physical and emotional intimacy that having a partner brings.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Sugar dating doesn't always use money as a medium of exchange — Sugar Daddies may also "pay" their Sugar Babies in the form of professional advancement, mentorship, bill payments, or gifts.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Don't buy into the sensationalist stories sometimes shown in the media — a sugar dating relationship can take many different forms. At Sharing Sugar, we let people engage in any (legal) relationship that suits them best.

                            First, Sugar Babies and Sugar Daddies (or sugar mommies) find each other. Although (very) occasionally, this happens organically through an in-person meeting, Sugar Babies and Sugar Daddies almost always meet online on websites like Sharing Sugar. This ensures everyone is on the same page and nobody gets offended or freaked out.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Once a Sugar Daddy and Sugar Baby connect, the next step should always be communication.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There are many different types of sugar dating relationships. Some involve sexual relations, while others include no physical touch at all; some Sugar Daddies pay a monthly "allowance" to their Sugar Babies, while others give opportunities for career advancement.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The type of Sugar Daddy relationships we hear about most in the media involve Sugar Babies who receive money from their Sugar Daddies to engage in sexual relations. In reality, this isn't representative. <a href="https://phys.org/news/2019-10-sugar-daddy-relationships.html" target="_blank">40%</a> of Sugar Babies have never had sex with their sugar parents. Of those that do, it's often out of a genuine desire of both parties to become intimate after developing an emotional bond.
                        </p>

                        <div class="row">
                            <div class="col-md-6">
                                <p>
                                    With so much variation between relationships, it's essential to establish boundaries and expectations early on. Both parts need to agree on the payment structure and relationship boundaries to avoid problems further down the line. Naturally, you might want to adjust expectations later on. Some Sugar Babies warm to the idea of sexual relations after developing an emotional connection with their Sugar Daddies, while some Sugar Daddies begin with a fixed payment per date and move to a generous monthly allowance.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Once you have an agreement in place, the next stage is to meet up. On the first few meetings, be sure to take extra precautions, like meeting in a public place.

                            <a href="https://sharingsugar.com/en/blog" target="_blank">For your first date,</a> we recommend going to a place where you can have a nice chat. Since it’s the first time you’re meeting, you’ll probably have lots of questions to ask each other, so it’s best to choose somewhere quiet. If there’s also great food and somewhere to take a stroll, even better!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Going to the cinema isn’t a great option since there’s no chance to talk or even look at each other – this can make the date awkward. At the other end of the spectrum, going somewhere so noisy that you have to scream to communicate (like a nightclub) is also far from ideal.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Remember that first impressions are important; the information you exchange during the first date is crucial for establishing the expectations for the rest of the relationship.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When you get past the first date and feel more comfortable with each other, you can choose from a broader range of date locations.
                        </p>

                            Before you enter into a Sugar Daddy relationship, you need to consider how you're going to exchange money. It might sound trivial, but choosing the wrong option could lead to problems with the taxman, the law, or being scammed.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Here are the pros and cons of the most popular payment methods:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Cash.</strong> The principal advantage of cash is that it's untraceable — nobody needs to worry about suspicious-looking transactions appearing on their bank account. However, it can be difficult for a Sugar Baby to handle huge wads of cash, and there's also the risk of it being lost or stolen.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Bank deposit.</strong> This is one of the most secure ways to exchange money, but it also has a considerable disadvantage: a high volume of big-number transactions could arouse suspicions from banks or tax authorities. Proceed with caution.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>PayPal.</strong> It might be convenient, but PayPal has a few drawbacks. As with bank deposits, PayPal keeps a digital record of every transaction made. It will also contact tax authorities if you exceed a certain number of transactions in a year — in the US, that's $20,000 or 200 payments (whichever comes first).
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Peer-to-peer options.</strong> There are plenty of options that work similarly to PayPal out there, including CashApp, Venmo, and more. These apps also keep a transaction record but may not report it to the government.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Prepaid cards.</strong>Using a prepaid card is an excellent way to get around the traceability of digital payments and the inconvenience of cash — the Sugar Daddy simply loads up a card for his Sugar Baby.

                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Bill payments or gifts.</strong> Another option is for a Sugar Daddy to pay for things directly for his Sugar Baby, whether that's a rent payment or a designer handbag. However, some Sugar Babies might prefer not to disclose what they spend their money on, and it's less convenient for Sugar Daddies to pay for individual items.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Bitcoin or cryptocurrency.</strong> For anyone worrying about leaving a digital footprint, cryptocurrencies are the perfect solution — you can receive payments anonymously without anyone knowing. However, handling cryptocurrency payments is technical and complex, so it's not suitable for everyone.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Money transfer sites.</strong> If a Sugar Daddy and Sugar Baby live in different countries, a money transfer site like Revolut, Transferwise, or Global Remit has fewer fees than using PayPal or bank transfers. This is worth considering for American Sugar Daddies who want to pay Mexican Sugar Babies, but these services also leave a digital footprint.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                            Bear in mind that not all Sugar Daddies pay their Sugar Babies – some offer professional advancement opportunities instead, and others are "experience daddies" who only pay for dates. However, this is less common.

                        <p>Without dedicated platforms, it's difficult for Sugar Babies and Sugar Daddies to connect— a Sugar Daddy dating site plays this role. </p>

                        <p>At Sharing Sugar, both Sugar Babies and Sugar Daddies can register for free. The process is simple: just <a href="https://sharingsugar.com/en/sign-up">sign up,</a> put in your details (including a photo), and start looking for a match. We have thousands of members' profiles for you to browse!</p>

                        <p>But bear in mind that the role of a Sugar Daddy dating site is to bring people together. The way you interact outside of the platform, including how you meet up and arrange payment, is up to you.</p>

                        <p>The Sugar Baby stereotype might be of a pretty bimbo, but the reality is almost the opposite. Sugar daddies are intelligent, motivated men; they're often looking for ambitious and smart women. Naturally, traditional attractiveness and youth don't hurt. </p>

                        <p>In an ideal Sugar Daddy relationship, Sugar Babies genuinely enjoy learning from and spending time with older, wiser men. This often means a mentor/mentee relationship, business support, or at least companionship. Sugar babies must have clear goals and be able to offer intellectually stimulating conversations.</p>

                        <p>But even if a Sugar Baby is "only" offering companionship, don't underestimate how difficult it can be. Getting paid to go on dates sounds easy, but it's challenging and tiring to spend hours talking to somebody and taking an interest in their life – especially in situations that can be awkward and uncomfortable. Sugar babies need to be charismatic and natural conversationalists.</p>

                        <p>Although some men expect sex, this isn't necessarily part of the role of being a Sugar Baby. However, most Sugar Daddies expect their Sugar Babies to take pride in their appearance. Make sure to dress nicely – often more formally than you would usually – and make an effort with your hair, makeup, and nails.</p>

                        <p>For Sugar Daddies looking for an entirely transactional relationship, their primary responsibility is to pay their Sugar Baby and make sure she feels looked after. This could also involve making travel arrangements and ensuring a good line of communication.</p>

                        <p>Others take a much more involved role in the life of their Sugar Baby and go beyond the typical arrangements. They might offer internships, business support, or emotional support.</p>

                        <p>Ultimately, every Sugar Daddy has a different approach. Just make sure you're covering the bare minimum by making your Sugar Baby feel safe and comfortable.</p>

                            Thanks to the internet, communicating in a foreign language is easier than ever. The best-known and most user-friendly translation service is Google Translate. It’s not always perfect, but 95% of the time, you can rely on it to translate the meaning of what you want to say,
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            You can either use the website or download the app, which can be a lifesaver when you’re finding your way around Mexico and want to speak to merchants or find a restroom.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            As well as typing, the app lets you look up translations using voice recognition – harness it by clicking the little microphone symbol. You can also use “conversation mode,” which lets both parties speak in their native languages and still communicate, or take pictures with your camera (e.g., of signs and restaurant menus).
                        </p>

                                    For the best translation experience, opt for a Mexican data plan. Depending on your US cell phone provider, your phone might already have service in Mexico, but you’re likely to face poor reception in certain areas. The infrastructure in Mexico isn’t as established as in the US, so it’s best to get a Mexican SIM with a data plan you can use in your existing phone.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    If your phone has “dual SIM” capabilities, you can conveniently use two SIM cards simultaneously – but your phone mustbe “unlocked,” which is unlikely if you’re paying for it through a monthly contract.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    By purchasing a Mexican SIM, you’ll get a Mexican phone number, which is more convenient for communicating with people in the country.

                            You might not have filled in your profile optimally. Did you choose flattering,
                            high-quality
                            photos that reflect the type of arrangement you're looking for? Unfortunately, opting
                            for a
                            bikini photo might give Sugar Daddies the impression that you're offering sexual
                            services,
                            leading to the wrong types of messages.

                        <p>
                            Also, bear in mind that Sugar Daddies might do a reverse image search – does your social

                        </p>

                            But it's not just about how you look — despite the stereotypes, (most) Sugar Daddies
                            also
                            care about your personality! Many look for ambitious women they can have interesting
                            conversations with. On Sharing Sugar, you can fill in the type of arrangement you're
                            looking

                            But things can actually go far deeper than that. Sugar daddies often serve as business
                            mentors for ambitious young women. One example is Barbara Corcoran, who famously said
                            she
                            landed investment and a business partner <a

                            Trump, who some speculate to have a sugar-type relationship with her husband.

                            Getting a Sugar Daddy can be an empowering move. The arrangement allows you to receive
                            financial and emotional support without being forced to compromise, start a family, or
                            become a housewife.

                            Unfortunately,
                            when you're highly successful and career-motivated, it's challenging to balance a

                        <p>
                            Having a Sugar Baby is almost like having a girlfriend that you only see when it's
                            convenient for you. You can enjoy the company of somebody who will only see you as often
                            or
                            as infrequently as you like without the jealousy, restraints, and expectations of a
                            regular
                            relationship.

                            Lots of Sugar Daddy websites have a few problems. Many allow – or even encourage – users
                            to
                            exchange pictures. This often makes Sugar Babies uncomfortable as images can turn
                            sexual. At
                            Sharing Sugar, we overcome this problem by not allowing photo exchanges.

                            There are two main ways Sugar Babies receive money: payment per meeting (PPM) or a
                            monthly
                            allowance.

                        <p>
                            For those receiving an allowance, the average Sugar Baby makes at least $650 a month
                            (about
                            $15,000 MXN), working out at about $45 ($1,000 MXN) an hour. For those earning a set
                            PPM,
                            $100 to $200 ($3,000 to $4,000 MXN) is a reasonable amount.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The exact allowance depends on a few factors: the supply of Sugar Daddies, demand for
                            Sugar
                            Babies, how much time is spent together, and the kinds of activities carried out.

                            The average Sugar Daddy gives around $650 a month ($15,000 MXN) to his Sugar Baby, or
                            $100
                            to $200 ($3,000 to $4,000 MXN) per meeting. However, you might want to give your Sugar

                            more or less money than this.

                        <p>
                            When agreeing on an allowance, consider:

                            <li>Is your arrangement exclusive?</li>
                            <li>Do you require your Sugar Baby to travel or buy anything?</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>
                            The more commitment and effort you're demanding from a Sugar Baby, the more you should
                            pay –
                            they're taking time out of their life to spend with you.

                            Some Sugar Daddies pay a fixed amount per meeting, whereas others pay a monthly

                            To begin with, it may be best to opt for a payment per meeting.

                            But not all Sugar Daddies are rich. A "splenda daddy" is the name for a Sugar Daddy on a

                            Don't assume that the wealthier a Sugar Daddy is, the more generous he will be with your
                            allowance. Sometimes, you might find a Sugar Daddy who is not particularly wealthy but
                            still
                            wants to spend money on a Sugar Baby.

                            As a Sugar Baby, you'll usually receive your money as a gift, which isn't taxable. Of
                            course, if you're receiving significant sums as “gifts” throughout the year, it can look
                            suspicious to the taxman. Many Sugar Babies prefer to keep their allowance in cash to
                            avoid
                            these complications.

                        <p>
                            The IRS requires banks to report any transactions over $10,000 to investigate potential
                            cases of money laundering and drug trafficking. PayPal will also inform the taxman if
                            you
                            receive more than $20,000 in transactions per year. However, every country has different
                            tax
                            rules, so be sure to check your government’s stance.

                            Occasionally, you might come across a Sugar Daddy who wants to pay you as a contractor
                            so he
                            can deduct your money as tax. However, this is risky for you.

                            When you first find a Sugar Daddy, it can be awkward and uncomfortable to sort out your
                            allowance. But don't wait for him to bring it up – some men try to secure a date (or
                            even
                            sexual relations) for free, later ghosting the girl.

                        <p>
                            We recommend asking for an allowance as soon as you begin talking to a Sugar Daddy. Make
                            sure he pays you before the date if you're traveling.

                            Different Sugar Daddies have different arrangements for transferring money to their
                            Sugar
                            Babies. Some pay a regular allowance (e.g., $600 USD or $15,000 MXN per month) while
                            others
                            pay a set amount per meeting (e.g., $3,000 MXN or $100 USD per date)
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Paying per meeting (PPM) is often the best way to begin the relationship until you build
                            more trust. You probably don't want multiple meetings without receiving payment as your
                            Sugar Daddy could do a runner and never pay you; equally, Sugar Daddies worry a Sugar
                            Baby
                            could run off with their money.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The safest way to get around this is for the Sugar Daddy to pay before the first date or
                            transfer the money while you're together.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            If you're traveling to meet your Sugar Daddy, you should rarely be paying out of your
                            own
                            pocket to fill up your gas tank or buy your plane ticket. A good Sugar Daddy will always
                            cough up for your travel expenses beforehand. Of course, if you're already receiving a
                            monthly allowance of a few thousand dollars, it's reasonable for you to cover your own
                            costs.

                            Sugar babies face the greatest danger, but Sugar Daddies also need to be careful. There
                            are
                            plenty of people who would like to target rich men putting themselves in vulnerable

                                    To minimize risk, arrange to meet in a public place. Also, make sure your family
                                    and
                                    friends know where you are. You can also use an app like Find My Friends to give
                                    them your exact location at all times through your phone.

                                    Another good way to "vet" a Sugar Daddy or Sugar Baby is to spend a while
                                    chatting
                                    before you meet up – if they just want to meet up as soon as possible without
                                    getting to know you first, it's a bad sign.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Finally, consider protecting your real identity and adopting an anonymous
                                    identity
                                    instead. It’s common practice for both Sugar Daddies and Sugar Babies to do
                                    this.
                                    However, you still need to use a real photo – just take a new picture you
                                    haven’t
                                    used elsewhere on social media so nobody can do a reverse image search.

                            of
                            caution, bring a friend with you – and, if you're traveling, make the Sugar Daddy pay
                            for
                            the friend to go with you.

                            Some Sugar Daddies might try to persuade you to meet them in a private space, using an
                            excuse about them being a public figure or married. If this happens, suggest meeting in
                            a
                            private booth in a restaurant or similar.

                        <p>
                            When you meet somebody for the first time, trust your gut instinct and look out for more
                            red
                            flags. Just because they don't attempt to kidnap you within the first hour, it doesn't
                            mean
                            it's safe to be with them. It's best to test someone's character over multiple meetings
                            and
                            build up trust before you meet up in private.

                                    gifts they will buy you "in the future" to manipulate you into staying in the

                                    You can avoid reversed transactions by making sure your Sugar Daddy selects the
                                    "family and friends" option on PayPal rather than the "goods and services"
                                    button.
                                    Also, steer clear of anyone who wants to send money by Western Union or check.

                                    It's not advisable to send explicit photos to a Sugar Daddy, especially if you
                                    haven't yet met him or you don't know each other very well. Although swapping
                                    pictures can be fun, it's best to establish trust first. That's why we don't

                            Sugar Baby isn’t worth the risk of something bad happening or the emotional labor

                            sugar
                            dating can be extremely beneficial, convenient, and worthwhile. It may be
                            time-consuming,
                            and you certainly need to know what you want in advance, but both parties stand to gain
                            enormously from a good Sugar Daddy or Sugar Baby.

                            Prostitution is illegal in the USA and many other countries, but sugar dating isn't a
                            purely
                            transactional arrangement. Although some arrangements might involve sex if both parties
                            develop a connection, Sugar Babies are paid for mutually beneficial arrangements – not
                            purely for sex.

                            Many people think sugar dating is synonymous with prostitution. In reality, this isn't
                            always the case —some Sugar Daddies just want companionship.

                                    relationships — sugar dating is usually a long-term arrangement rather than
                                    occasional or one-off meetings.

                                    involved are pursuing the arrangement as a lifestyle choice. But the reality is
                                    that
                                    many Sugar Babies are vulnerable young women who are desperate for money; they
                                    might
                                    feel obliged to do things they're not comfortable with to get that money.

                                    The best sugar relationships involve mutual understanding. If you don't truly
                                    feel
                                    comfortable about being a Sugar Baby, it could be a dark route for you to go
                                    down.
                                    However, if you think you could enjoy the relationship, there's no need to feel
                                    guilty or ashamed.

                            It's very unusual for a Sugar Daddy to be younger than his Sugar Baby — men who can
                            afford
                            to maintain a Sugar Baby tend to be older and at the peak of their profession. In
                            contrast,
                            Sugar Babies tend to be younger women who are in the greatest need of money. The average
                            age
                            for a Sugar Daddy is 38, while the average age of a Sugar Baby is 25.

                            In theory, a Sugar Daddy can be younger than his Sugar Baby. Many older women in their
                            thirties or forties enjoy a Sugar Baby lifestyle — even if they're not desperate for the
                            extra money, they may like the pragmatism of the relationship and the gifts. Meanwhile,
                            there are plenty of wealthy men in their twenties who could afford Sugar Babies. There's
                            no

                            beginning their lives and careers, and many Sugar Daddies prefer young women.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            But despite the stereotypes, it's not true that Sugar Daddies are only interested in
                            teens
                            and women in their early twenties. Older Sugar Daddies in their forties or fifties are
                            likely to feel uncomfortable with this age gap and prefer someone slightly older.

                            There are no hard and fast rules for sugar dating — each relationship works differently.
                            However, it's very unusual for sugar relationships to be exclusive; one of the main
                            perks is
                            having a flexible arrangement with minimal commitment.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            It's common for Sugar Daddies to have multiple Sugar Babies and for Sugar Babies to have
                            multiple Sugar Daddies. So, in theory, it’s possible to have both a Sugar Daddy and a
                            boyfriend. However, you might run into some complications and problems.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            If you're fully committed to your relationship with your boyfriend, your Sugar Daddy
                            might
                            feel you're emotionally distant from him and not enjoying the relationship. This could
                            lead
                            them to call off the relationship. Equally, your boyfriend could become jealous of your
                            Sugar Daddy and pressure you to stop seeing him.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Just make sure everyone involved is aware of what's happening and consents to the
                            arrangement. Never lie to your boyfriend about having a Sugar Daddy or to your Sugar
                            Daddy
                            about having a boyfriend.

                        <p>
                            Although the media portrays most Sugar Daddies as wanting sex or at least physical
                            relations
                            like kissing or cuddling, it's common for Sugar Daddy relationships to be based purely
                            on
                            companionship.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Since Sugar Daddies tend to be extraordinarily career-driven, it's often difficult for
                            them
                            to maintain close friendships – they involve a level of commitment and effort that busy
                            people can't afford to give.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            That's where Sugar Babies come in. A normal friend might not be thrilled at the prospect
                            of
                            having someone in their life who can’t prioritize the relationship and only wants to
                            meet up
                            on their own terms — but a Sugar Baby won’t mind.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            But remember, if you're being paid solely on your conversational abilities, you need to
                            be
                            good at what you do! Make sure you keep the conversation flowing, ask your Sugar Daddy
                            plenty of questions, and keep him entertained. You could ask him about:
                        </p>
                        <ul class="mb-5">
                            <li>Hobbies</li>
                            <li>Music</li>

                            <li>Life goals </li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>
                            Don't be afraid to take things a little deeper – although you might want to wait until
                            later
                            dates.

                            Unfortunately, there are a lot of "Sugar Daddy" scams on the internet. One of these
                            scams
                            involves victims being asked to <a href="https://thehustle.co/phone-scam-gift-cards/"

                            and
                            recuperate money from. Usually, the scammers pretend to be a government agency, but they
                            could also pose as a Sugar Daddy.

                        <p>
                            A real Sugar Daddy would never ask for money or a gift card, even if he promises to pay

                            For anyone hoping to head over to Rosarito and meet a sugar baby in person, bear in mind
                            that this probably isn’t the easiest location to choose. Rosarito is a fairly small
                            place
                            (population of around 70,250) that’s more of a beachside resort than a major city. You
                            might
                            have more luck in a large city with a big student population, like Tijuana.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            However, Rosarito does have a couple of colleges: the <a

                                href="https://ur.edu.mx/" target="_blank">the Universidad Rosaritense.</a> Since
                            Rosarito has a great nightlife scene, you could meet any students interested in a Sugar
                            Daddy relationship in one of the clubs or bars known for bringing in Americans.

                            In Mexico, there’s minimal financial support for students who want to go to university.
                            Although public universities offer degrees at a reasonable cost and there are some
                            additional scholarships available for the brightest students, most young people rely on
                            support from their parents to make it through their studies.

                            Naturally, sugar dating is another route some students take to fund their college
                            careers.

                                    When you cross the border to Mexico for the first time, it’s best not to drive.
                                    You
                                    won’t know the traffic conditions, the best routes, or other similar details.
                                    Even
                                    if you use a GPS, it might not give you accurate information. This could ruin
                                    the
                                    whole experience!

                                    Instead, we recommend walking or taking an Uber – a much safer option than a
                                    standard taxi service. If you do order an Uber, set your final destination to
                                    Otay
                                    or San Ysidro.

                                    Make sure you stay in contact with your Sugar Baby at all times, and arrange to
                                    meet
                                    them at the point you enter the country. They should be able to guide you
                                    through
                                    the rest of your stay and tell you anything else you need to know.

                            Finally, don’t be afraid of Tijuana. Although it might get a bad reputation in the
                            press,
                            it’s a safe place to be as long as you practice basic caution, like keeping your
                            valuables
                            out of sight and not wandering around the streets alone at night.
